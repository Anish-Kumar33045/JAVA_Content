 *  time complextity
 *  -we always look complexity for worst case
 *  -                   " "   large data
 *  - even thogh the value of actual time is different they grow linearly
 *    y=x;
 *    y=2x;
 *    y=3x;  
 * 
 *  - we don't care about actual time but care about what relation b/w the inputdata size and time
 *  - we ignore all constants y=3x+5 ; (ignore 5)
 *   here 3x+5 means it starts after some time duration of 5 units but we don't care
 *  
 *  - let O(N^3 + log N ) 
 *    as we care of large data while focusing on time complexity analysis ignore log N ;
