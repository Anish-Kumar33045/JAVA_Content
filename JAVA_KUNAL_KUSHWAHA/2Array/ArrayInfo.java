/*

 - Array objects are stored in heap memory 
 - heap objects (array) are not continous
 - Dynamic memory allocation ---> the memory is stored in run time in heap memory 
 - these are maynot be continous  - all because of JVM
 - index of array starts from 0
 - syntax of creating the array is 
   Datatype[] variable = new Datatype[size];
 - Datatype[] variable = { 2,3,4,5,elements} is also valid in java

 - after intialising the array without storing any values then zero or null in case of String is stored by Default
 
 - String arr = new String[5];
  this object array not the primitive array
  arr is reference variable stored in stack 
  the elements are stored in heap memory
